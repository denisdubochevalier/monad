// Package monad provides an extensive implementation of various monadic
// structures, encapsulating a wide range of computational design patterns.
// These include: Maybe, Either, Result, Identity, List, Reader, Writer, and
// State.
//
// Originating from category theory and serving as computational building blocks
// in functional programming, monads enable fine-grained control over
// programmatic side-effects, sequencing, and value context.
//
// Every monad implemented in this package rigorously adheres to the three
// foundational monadic laws:
// - Left Identity:  return a >>= f  is equivalent to  f(a)
// - Right Identity: m >>= return  is equivalent to  m
// - Associativity:  (m >>= f) >>= g  is equivalent to  m >>= (\x -> f x >>= g)
//
// The following monads are implemented:
//   - Maybe: Represents optional values and handles the absence of a value.
//   - Either: Extends Maybe by encapsulating an error or alternate reason for
//     the absence of a value.
//   - Result: Tailored to Go's idiomatic error handling, encapsulating either a
//     successful result or an error.
//   - Identity: The simplest monad, acting as a container for a single value.
//   - List: Represents a collection of values in a monadic context.
//   - Reader: Encapsulates a shared environment required by various
//     computations.
//   - Writer: Captures additional output during the computation, useful for
//     logging or state tracing.
//   - State: Allows the embedding of stateful computations within the monadic
//     structure.
//   - Validation Monad: To accumulate all errors rather than failing fast,
//     useful in form validation.
//
// Upcoming Monads:
//   - Continuation Monad: Suited for asynchronous or nested computations.
//   - IO Monad: To encapsulate effectful computations in a functional style.
//   - Future/Promise Monad: An academic endeavor given Go's native concurrency
//     model.
//   - Free Monad: An advanced construct to build interpreters for embedded
//     DSLs.
//
// Each monad is endowed with functional methods like `FlatMap` and `Map` to
// facilitate composability and side-effect management.
//
// Usage:
// Consult the associated documentation for each individual monad to explore
// example usage and further details.
